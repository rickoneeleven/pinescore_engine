# AGENTS.md v12.9

## Session Bootstrap (Mandatory)
Execute immediately at session start. Do not wait for user input.
### Update & Announce
-  Run these exact command in the terminal to fetch the raw instructions and prompt templates:
        `curl -L -o AGENTS.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_683df4954cc0f4.04393849.raw`
		`mkdir -p ops`
		`mkdir -p AGENTS_templates`
		`curl -L -o AGENTS_templates/ops_doc.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_6933ea5d23a972.77882341.raw`
		`curl -L -o AGENTS_templates/ops_doc_testing.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_6937215203a8a8.59822398.raw`
		`curl -L -o AGENTS_templates/reed_me.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_68ff55fd1533e2.81140451.raw`
		`curl -L -o AGENTS_templates/recreation_process.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_6933f026c6a668.10234364.raw`
		`curl -L -o AGENTS_templates/follow_up.md https://notes.pinescore.com/note/note_694567f92d13c2.94832269.raw`
- Output: "Bootstrapping: fetched latest AGENTS.md. Scanning documentation for integrity checks."
### Discovery & Awareness
- Run these discovery commands:
  - Enforce single root README: `find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -iname 'README.md' -printf '%p\n' | sort`
  - List `ops/` top-level entries (files + folders): `find ops -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -printf '%f\n' | sort`
  - List top-level ops docs only: `ls -1 ops/*.md 2>/dev/null || true`
  - Check `follow_up.md` robustly (avoid false negatives): `ls -la follow_up.md 2>/dev/null || echo 'follow_up.md missing'`
- Ingest: Read the content of `ops/*.md` only (top-level, non-recursive). Do not ingest any `ops/**` subfolder files unless the task requires opening them (only note subfolder names).
- If `follow_up.md` exists in project root:
  - Ingest it.
  - Treat it as a short-lived feature PRD plus validation checklist.
  - In each new session, actively try to complete unchecked validation items and remove finished feature sections.
  - If the file lacks clear purpose or structure, rewrite it using `AGENTS_templates/follow_up.md` while preserving the existing feature notes and validation items.
### Integrity Check (30-Day Rule)
- Check header `DATETIME of last agent review:` in README.md and all ops/*.md files.
- < 30 days: Proceed. Only `ops/*.md` (top-level) docs are ingested.
- > 30 days or Missing: **BLOCK** user task. Trigger Validation Procedure immediately.
### Handover
- Provide project overview, `ops/` file list. Check for a follow_up.md in project root, if there is one, remind the user there are some pending actions to be complete, and last line should be local AGENTS.md version number (make it obvious/highlight, capitals whatever, if version number was updated during curl). Proceed with user request only after validation.

## Validation Procedure
Trigger: Stale (>30 days) or missing timestamp in `README.md` or `ops/*.md`.
### Recreation (Not Patching)
- Follow process in `AGENTS_templates/recreation_process.md`.
- Read existing docs for context, then delete and rebuild from scratch.
- Use `AGENTS_templates/reed_me.md` for README.md. **Preserve operational knowledge** - setup procedures, config examples, troubleshooting.
- Use `AGENTS_templates/ops_doc.md` for each ops/ file (max 40 lines each).
- Use `AGENTS_templates/ops_doc_testing.md` for testing-related ops/ files (e.g., ops/TESTING.md, ops/E2E.md).
- Crawl codebase for current state (package.json, src/, .env.example, service configs).
### Attest
- Update header: `DATETIME of last agent review: DD MMM YYYY HH:MM (Europe/London)` on all recreated files.

## Documentation Philosophy
- **README** = HOW to deploy (for humans, detailed setup, NOT ingested)
- **ops/** = WHAT exists (for agents, awareness/pointers, ingested at startup)
- README can be ~175 lines with section budgets
- ops/ docs must be max 40 lines each

## Testing Protocol (Mandatory)
**Run tests after every new feature.** This rule persists through all ops/ audits and recreations.
- After implementing any new feature or change, run relevant tests before marking complete.
- Tests must be designed for rapid agent execution (<30s unit, <2min integration).
- On test failure: fix immediately, do not defer.
- Document test commands in testing ops/ docs using `AGENTS_templates/ops_doc_testing.md`.

## Development Principles
### Architecture & Quality
- Layered: Strict separation (Interface vs Logic vs Data). No logic in Interface.
- SRP: One reason to change per class/fn.
- DI: Inject dependencies. No `new Service()` in constructors.
- Readability: Self-documenting names. No explanatory comments (only *why*). DRY. Simplicity.
### Robustness & Constraints
- Errors: Exception-driven only. No return codes/nulls.
- Typing: Strictest available type system.
- Size: Max 400 lines per file.

## Tool Usage
- Use wget/curl for fetching remote images that you need to view

## Other
- You have permission to read project .env and related files. this will help for operations like quering DB etc.
- if changes require service reload/rebuild, apache restart, whatever, JUST DO IT - sick of wasting turns because you never built/restarted.
- Commit and push every time there are no more next steps for current task - do not ask for confirmation.

## Communication
- Style: Direct, fact-based. Push back on errors. No en/em dashes.
- Questions: Numbered questions only. Always provide recommendation + reasoning.

## Staged Implementation & Evidence (Mandatory)
- Implement changes in small, clearly separated stages.
- After each stage that introduces a **new behavior** or **external call** (e.g. API request, new DB query, new background job), the agent **must stop** and:
- Describe the new capability in 1-3 sentences.
- Show concrete evidence that it is working (e.g. exact command/URL used, log snippet, API response, or SQL query + sample rows).
- Wait for explicit user approval before proceeding to the next stage.
- The agent must **not** wire multi-stage features end-to-end in one pass; each stage should be observable and testable on its own.
- Always update ops/ documentation whenever any related changes have been made.
